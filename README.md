# MyGlastCode
 Bits and bobs of old Fermi code. Amongst other things programs to :
 - Read the MAGIC-7 data and translate them to FT2 entries on the fly
 - Sort MAGIC-7 entries and write them
 - Calculate the Lomb/Scargle periodogram using maximum likelihood
 - Calculate exposure on orbit
 - Estimate PSF from data using catalog
 - Calculate flaring probability using exponential distribution
